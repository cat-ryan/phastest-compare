# PHASTEST Compare
PHASTEST (PHAge Search Tool with Enhanced Sequence Translation) is a web server for the identification and annotation of prophage sequences in bacterial genomes. The program was created by the Wishart Research Group at University of Alberta (doi: [10.1093/nar/gkad382](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad382)). 
PHASTEST already has great data visualization tools, especially if you're looking to create a genome map with your results.

If you want to look at differences between genomes, however, you'll need to do a little extra work. This repository contains scripts to help you compare the PHASTEST results for different genomes a little more easily.

### PHASTEST Gene Types
phastest-genetypes.R runs through a set of PHASTEST predictions and generates a stacked bar chart of the number of total predicted prophage genes and the number of each "type" of gene for each organism. It's important to note one major limitation of this workflow is that the gene "types" are relatively arbitrary. You're free to adjust them to better suit your own data.

### PHASTEST Summary
phastest-summary.R uses the summary.txt file generated by PHASTEST for each genome to tell you the percentage of each genome that is predicted to be phage derived.
